            <h3>About the Cock</h3>
            <p>Hello there, I'm Razz a digital artist who draws and tries to adapt in different styles.
                <br>
                Currently working as a Freelancer and Partial Contract for different industries: Game Development, Character Design and Concept Art.
                I do most of my works using Clip Studio Paint and PSD.
                <br>
                <br>
                My first steps in digital art was back approx. in 2015 using only CorelDraw and Excel (yes you can draw on it!). But started to post to the world since 2017.
                Because first draws where beyond cringe (not saying that still is).
                <br>
                <br>
                As soon I saw some populars animes in the 90' I said to myself I need to do that! so grabbed a pencil and any paper.
                Time passed and in the new millenium of the gods I was armed with a ps2. I had the chance to know the series of Legacy of Kain and Psychonauts. Where the name and avatar
                is based from this games.
                <br>
                My influences are a lot, but here a couple: Hideaki Anno, Hayao Miyazaki, Amy Hennig (Crystal Dynamics), Pixar, Xavier Houssin (Ankama), Dark Souls series and Chris Cold.
                <br>
                <br>
                Skills are not only attached to "the draw thing" but sometimes: wirtting (mostly), gaming dev, basic programming, video editing and hardware computer fix.
                <br>
                <br>
                Congrats now you know me 99%.
